## Features

### Resources

One of the biggest differences
### Snapshots

When a snapshot is recorded, it's socked away in its raw form so you can come back at a later time and review the exact state of a given resource without having to piece individual metrics together.

### Metrics

Snapshots are also broken up and saved as individual attribute/value pairs, which enables you to track a particular attribute over a given period of time. 


## Roadmap

* Documentation. Like, seriously.
* Log to STDOUT like a proper service.
* Callbacks! Decide what happens after data gets collected.
* Taggable resources and snapshots
## TODO

* Let config file be, er, configurable
